# Guidelines
- Each subsystem/command added is a commit
- All work on a subsystem or its commands should be done on the subsystem branch
- **Use relevant names**
- Subsystem list and properties is at [`subsystems/subsystems.md`](./subsystems/subsystems.md)
- Command list and descriptions is at [`commands/commands.md`](./commands/commands.md)
- Make sure code compiles before commit (and push) - run `gradlew build` or use `ctrl+F9` in IntelliJ
